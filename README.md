# Europe's Top 5 Leagues Analysis
## Introduction
In this project, I scrape through 5 different links that each correspond to one of the biggest 5 european leagues. As you might imagine, there is a large amount of data managed and I advise that my scraping takes around 18 minutes to process.

## The data
### 1. Average Goals per Match
This first stat is about the average number of goals scored on each league's matches.

### 2. Highest / Lowest Average Goals per Match
Here, similar to the first statistic, the graph is done by getting the 5 teams with most averaged goals per match and the 5 teams with least averaged goals.

### 3. Shots/Goals Comparison
This graph tries to observe the relation between shots and goals scored. Leagues with higher-goal/lower-shot relation are valued higher in this project.

### 4. Passes per Match
Here we can see which teams have the highest average number of passes per match. Such teams are said to be more valued as they show control over the game.

### 5. Average Shots on Target
This graph shows the teams with highest number of shots on target (those shots that are headed between the 3 goal posts) per match. Again, these teams are valued because they show their consistency on being able to create goal occasions.

### 6. Average Fouls per Match
We can see the leagues in order of the amount of fouls per match. A high number of this statistic can mean 2 things. The first one, that teams in that league lack ability to play smoothly and without interruption. And secondly, a critic to the way that referees do their job in the different leagues. It is no surprise to see La Liga up top.

### 7. Types of Shots Distribution
This graphs show the different distributions of the different types of shots that can occur in a match, separated by league.

The 3 types of shots are:
- On target: those shots that are headed within the 3 goal posts and that are blocked by the goalkpeer.
- Off target: those shots that are not headed within the 3 goal posts.
- Blocked: those shots that are blocked by a defender or by a same-team player and that its direction can not be determined by such event.

### 8. Average Player Market Values
This data was manually inserted from the internet as I did not find time to do it in a web-scraping manner.

This chart show each league's investment in their own players, clearly showcasing which leagues have better football.

### 9. Game Simulation
I created a small 10-day league where I randomly made 4 teams of each league play against all other leagues, using the average goals per match so far this season, so it was updated to more recent events.

## Conclusion
I found very interesting to in-depth analyse the top 5 european leagues as this has been a recurrent topic in the past years as to where has La Liga gone after Messi and Cristiano left. I think it is safe to say that the decline of our league is obvious and, although savable, if we don't make changes this decline won't stop.
